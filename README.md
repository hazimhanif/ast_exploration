# Experiment 2-Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)

This repo is for the exploration of ASTs from different open source software packages.

## Parser  
* The main parser is [CodeSensor](https://github.com/fabsx00/codesensor) from Fabian Yamaguchi which he implemented in [Yamaguchi et. al. (2012)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2421003)
* The parser is based on Antlr 3.4 with **Island grammar** implementation as explained in [L. Moonen (2001)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/957806)
* Currently the parser only understand C/C++ source codes.

## Software Packages
